# What?

A Spec file for building an RPM package of [Aegisub DependencyControl](https://github.com/TypesettingTools/DependencyControl), a script manager for [Aegisub](https://aegisub.org).

This is largely adapted from the [AUR PKGBUILD](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=aegisub-dependency-control).

# Why?

Because I can and because I wanted to use it.

This repository is not related to or endorsed by the Aegisub Project. I do this in my free time for my own use.
